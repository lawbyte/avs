# AVS (APK Vulnerability Scanner)

AVS is a powerful security tool designed for scanning vulnerabilities in Android APK files. It leverages the Quark Engine to perform comprehensive security assessments, creates exploit APKs for testing, and provides mitigation strategies.

## Features

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Analyzes APK files to identify potential security weaknesses
- **Exploit APK Creation**: Generates exploit APKs for testing and research purposes
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Provides recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lawbyte/avs.git
cd avs
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Scanning an APK for Vulnerabilities

```
python avs.py scan -f path/to/application.apk [-v]
```

Options:
- `-f, --file`: Path to the APK file (required)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output (optional)

### Generating an Exploit APK

```
python avs.py exploit -f path/to/application.apk -v vulnerability_type [-o exploit.apk]
```

Options:
- `-f, --file`: Path to the original APK file (required)
- `-v, --vulnerability`: Vulnerability type to exploit (required)
- `-o, --output`: Output path for exploit APK (optional)

Available vulnerability types:
- `intent_redirection`
- `exported_components`
- `webview_javascript`
- `sql_injection`
- `broadcast_theft`

### Getting Mitigation Strategies

```
python avs.py mitigate [-f results.json] [-v vulnerability_type]
```

Options:
- `-f, --file`: Path to scan results file in JSON format (optional)
- `-v, --vulnerability`: Get mitigation for specific vulnerability (optional)

If no specific vulnerability is provided, mitigation strategies for all vulnerabilities in the results file will be shown.

## Vulnerability Types Detected

- Intent Redirection
- Insecure File Permissions
- SQL Injection
- WebView JavaScript Enabled
- Weak Cryptography
- Hardcoded Secrets
- Data Leakage
- Broadcast Theft
- Exported Components
- Path Traversal

## Example

1. Scan an APK file:
```
python avs.py scan -f target.apk
```

2. Generate an exploit for exported components:
```
python avs.py exploit -f target.apk -v exported_components -o exploit.apk
```

3. Show mitigation strategies for all detected vulnerabilities:
```
python avs.py mitigate -f results.json
```
